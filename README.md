👋 Hi, I’m @SowryaSree
👀 I’m interested in backend development, software engineering, and exploring innovative tech solutions, especially in telecommunications.
🌱 I’m currently learning 5G networks, LTE, and C++ concepts for telecommunication applications. Additionally, I’m enhancing my skills in Python, machine learning, along with backend frameworks and containerization with Docker.
💼 I completed an internship at DRDO(Defence Reasearch and development Organisation DYSL-AT,Young Scientist laboratory Dundigal,Hyderabad) where I have worked on a project called Optical flow and its applications in UAV and collision avoidance.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving backend development, machine learning, and network protocol optimizations in telecommunications.
📫 How to reach me: You can connect with me on LinkedIn(www.linkedin.com/in/sowryasree) or reach out via email(msowryasree993@gmail.com).
😄 Pronouns: She/Her
⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy breaking down complex tech concepts into easy-to-understand explanations, especially during presentations and workshops!
